## Agile Methodology
Neuroflex is created through an agile project management approach, through a number of 3 sprints.

Sprint 1 was dedicated to planning and the initial development of the application. This involves creating the main static layout pages and implementing register and login.

Sprint 2 was centered towards implementing the core functionalities of the application. This means creating the Java files that implement the logic behind the static pages.

Sprint 3 was to finalize and deploy the application. All functionalities of the pages are finalized in this sprint.

## Gitflow / Version Control
To manage the codebase efficiently, we adopted the Gitflow workflow for version control. In other words, we used a branching model that defines a strict branching structure for Git repositories. This makes it easier to track feature development, and bug fixes. 

We have three main feature branches, which are merged branches that act as test prototype deliverables for us. When creating new features, a new branch is always created to ensure that if a mistake is made, we can always go back to the previous branch.

The final product is then merged with the main branch.

## Firebase Technologies
Three firebase technologies are required to be used in this application. The chosen technologies are as follows:
- Firebase Authentication
- Firestore Database
- Firebase Analytics
